# sudoku-py

Simple Python (3.x required) script, that has to mimic my way of solving sudoku.

## Installation

```sh
chmod +x sudoku.py
./sudoku.py
```

## Usage

Put your sudoku in line 4. The default play is the hardest one, taken from (http://norvig.com/sudoku.html). It takes much more time to solve, than regular play.
